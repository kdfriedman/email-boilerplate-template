Responsive HTML Email Boilerplate Template

# Understanding the template:
Use these code examples as a reference for formatting your HTML email to avoid many hours of headaches, battling through the dreaded Outlook Word Rendering engine and beyond. You will notice that the markup is essentially a **_frankensteined_** template, filled with hacks, tricks, and conditional formatting. Although, this is not ideal, neither is accommodating 88 client's worth of email code bases. This template has worked wonders for my past email campaigns so I wanted to share with anyone who needed a solid foundation use or build upon.

# To use
If you'd like to use within your own email campaigns, simply replace all images with your own and adjust any styling to your liking.

**Bug Notes** 
This template has rendered successfully on 96% of Litmus and Emails on Acid email client tests. The templates that currently still have a couple of bugs are **_Outlook 2003 - Desktop and Lotus Notes 8 & 8.5_**. If you don't send emails to people that aren't using those clients, you should be in good shape. If the majority of your customerbase uses all three of these clients, please feel free submit a pull request and I'll happily merge into the master markup branch.
